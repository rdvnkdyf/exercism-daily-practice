# Exercism Solutions

This repository contains solutions to programming exercises I have completed on the [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org/) platform. Exercism is a great platform to practice and improve your skills in various programming languages.

## Purpose

The main goals of this repository are:

* To document my learning journey on Exercism.
* To showcase my problem-solving approaches in different programming languages.
* To serve as a reference point for other developers working on similar exercises.

## Contents

My solutions are organized into folders based on the language tracks provided by Exercism. Within each language folder, there is a separate folder for each exercise.

Currently included languages:

* **Python**: Algorithms and data structures exercises in Python.
* **C**: Fundamental programming and system-level exercises in C.
* **JavaScript**: Coming soon.

## How to Use the Solutions

Each exercise folder contains one or more files with the solution to the corresponding Exercism exercise. You can navigate to the respective language folder and then to the exercise folder to view the solutions.

**Please Note:** These solutions reflect my approach to problem-solving. There is often more than one way to solve a problem, and these solutions may not always be the most efficient or the most "Pythonic/C-like/JavaScript-like" way. Reviewing this repository before writing your own solutions might help you gain different perspectives.

## Contributing

If you find a bug in my solutions, have a suggestion for a better approach, or any ideas for improvement, feel free to open an "issue" or submit a "pull request." Your feedback and contributions are highly valued!
