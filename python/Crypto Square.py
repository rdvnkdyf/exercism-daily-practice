"""Crypto Square.

Given an English text, output the encoded version of that text.
First, the input is normalized: the spaces and punctuation are removed
from the English text and the message is down-cased.
Then, the normalized characters are broken into rows. These rows can be
regarded as forming a rectangle when printed with intervening newlines.
The plaintext should be organized in to a rectangle where c is the
number of columns and r is the number of rows, then for the rectangle
r x c find the smallest possible integer c such that:
    r * c >= length(message)
    and c >= r
    and c - r <= 1
The coded message is obtained by reading down the columns going left to
right. Output the encoded text in chunks that fill perfect rectangles
(r X c), with c chunks of r length, separated by spaces. For phrases that
are n characters short of the perfect rectangle, pad each of the last n
chunks with a single trailing space.
